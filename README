Choices:
- Anelasticity parameterisation
This informs the parameters we require a prior on, and the equations linking Vs to T. 
Therefore the anparam directory should contain a folder for each parameterisation, containing thermodynamic conversions and priors
- Data
This informs the type of comparison being made. 
Therefore the likelihood calculator should contain functions for each type of data constraint
- Algorithm
This informs how the {n+1}th model should be sampled based on the {n}th model. 
Therefore the algorithm/sampling directory should contain a choice of sampling functions 

Structure:
- Load in the data and data types (for sending to correct function)
- Select parameterisation choice and load in priors 
- Select algorithm choice and feed data, priors, starting model, number of trials

Analysis:
- Set of plots (running average, parameter trade-off, autocorrelation)
- Mean and std model, MAP model

Use: 
- Select choice of algorithm / data / parameterisation by modifying files in the options directory
- Run setup.py to apply these choices to the working directory 
- Run main.py to begin the inversion
