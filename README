### Welcome to BANCAL22, a code written to allow one to perform a Bayesian inversion for the calibration of experimental parameterisations of anelasticity.

This code is functional, but still in a state of development, and will be updated soon with more user-friendly features and instructions. 

In the mean time, feel free to send an email (j.hazzard20@imperial.ac.uk) if you need help with any aspect of using the code.

Choices:
- Anelasticity parameterisation
This informs the parameters we require a prior on, and the equations linking Vs to T. 
Therefore the anparam directory should contain a folder for each parameterisation, containing thermodynamic conversions and priors
- Data
This informs the type of comparison being made. 
Therefore the likelihood calculator should contain functions for each type of data constraint
- Algorithm
This informs how the {n+1}th model should be sampled based on the {n}th model. 
Therefore the algorithm/sampling directory should contain a choice of sampling functions 

Structure:
- Load in the data and data types (for sending to correct function)
- Select parameterisation choice and load in priors 
- Select algorithm choice and feed data, priors, starting model, number of trials

Analysis:
- Set of plots (running average, parameter trade-off, autocorrelation)
- Mean and std model, MAP model

Use: 
- Select choice of algorithm / data / parameterisation by modifying files in the options directory
- Run setup.py to apply these choices to the working directory 
- Run main.py to begin the inversion 

Dependencies:
- Python (3.8.10)
- numpy (1.22.3)
- pandas (1.5.3)
- scipy (1.8.0)

This code was developed on an Ubuntu (20.04) system.
