Choices:
- Anelasticity parameterisation
This informs the parameters we require a prior on, and the equations linking Vs to T. 
Therefore the anparam directory should contain a folder for each parameterisation, containing thermodynamic conversions and priors
- Data
This informs the type of comparison being made. 
Therefore the likelihood calculator should contain functions for each type of data constraint
- Algorithm
This informs how the {n+1}th model should be sampled based on the {n}th model. 
Therefore the algorithm/sampling directory should contain a choice of sampling functions
